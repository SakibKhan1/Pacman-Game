This is an implementation of the classic arcade game Pac-Man using C++. The game is played on a 20x10 board, and the goal is to collect all the dots while attempting to dodge the ghosts.

To run this program you will need to have a c++ compiler as this program is written in C++. Visual Studio Code is a good example.

The controls are "W", "A", "S", "D" to move your sprite.
